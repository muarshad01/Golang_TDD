## Writing tests

* Writing a test is just like writing a function, with a few rules
* It needs to be in a file with a name like 'xxx_test.go'
* The test function must start with the word Test
* The test function takes one argument only t *testing.T
* In order to use the *testing.T type, you need to import "testing", like we did with fmt in the other file
